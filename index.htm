    <h3>While going through high school, student Harish Bommakanti from Rouse High School in Leander, Texas
        felt frustrated whenever he needed to search extensively for resources to supplement his school education in order to fully understand
        a concept. Harish wished there could be an all inclusive "student corner" where one would
        find all things academic, from study guides for his upcoming unit test to SAT prep sites. Harish created this site in order to aid future high schoolers in going through
        the challenging high school process.

    <p>Math can be difficult for many high schoolers because of its complexity and the practice that is needed to develop mastery
        of the subject. Here are few resources to help with most high school math courses.</h2>
    
    <h2>Common high school mathematics courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Pre-AP/On Level Geometry, Pre-AP/On Level Algebra 2, On-Ramps/Pre-AP/On Level Pre-Calculus, AP/On Level Statistics*, AP Calculus AB*, AP Calculus BC*</h3>
    <p>
            These math courses aim to build on the fundamental algabraic concepts needed in college mathematics. There are plenty
            of sites that walk through problems step by step in order to educate students and help them understand the otherwise 
            complex math topics for high school students.
