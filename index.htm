    <h3>While going through high school, student Harish Bommakanti from Rouse High School in Leander, Texas
        felt frustrated whenever he needed to search extensively for resources to supplement his school education in order to fully understand
        a concept, whether it be in history or physics. Harish wished there could be an all inclusive "student corner" where one would
        find all things academic, from study guides for his upcoming unit test to SAT prep sites. Harish created this site to be the "student corner"
        for future high schoolers.

    <p>Math can be difficult for many high schoolers because of its complexity and the amount of practice that is needed to develop mastery
        of the subject. Here are few resources to help with most high school math courses.</h2>
    
    <h2>Common high school mathematics courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Pre-AP/On Level Geometry, Pre-AP/On Level Algebra 2, On-Ramps/Pre-AP/On Level Pre-Calculus, AP/On Level Statistics*, AP Calculus AB*, AP Calculus BC*</h3>
    <p>
            These math courses aim to build on the fundamental algabraic concepts needed in college mathematics. There are plenty
            of sites that walk through problems step by step in order to educate students and help them understand the otherwise 
            complex math topics for high school students.

    <h1 style = "text-align: center">College Planning</h1>
    <p>The college application process is stressful for every student because of how much needs to be accomplished. 
        Seniors need to choose their major and the colleges they want to apply to for that major, take exams such as the SAT and ACT, 
        write multiple essays for the schools they have chosen, and worry about the transition from high school to college. Here are some
        resources that will guide seniors through this tumultuous process.
    </p> <br>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center">SAT and ACT</h2>
    <p> The SAT and ACT are standardized exams that all high schoolers have to take in order to attend college. The Scholarly Aptitude
        Test, or SAT, tests on mathematics
        until Algebra 2 and some of Pre-Calculus, english comprehension, and writing skills. The American College Testing test, or ACT, tests on mathematics up to Pre-Calculus,
        english comprehension, writing skills, and scientific reasoning. High schoolers often study extensively but may not
        reap the benefits because they were not studying <i>correctly</i>. Use these resources to find practice tests and problem sets to narrow
        in on your weaknesses and attain a score that you will be comfortable with. You may need to use only one or a combination of these resources to reach your target score,
         based on your current level and your work ethic.

            <ul>
                <li>Khan Academy's SAT Practice Program is partnered with Collegeboard to link with your past PSAT** and SAT scores to detect which types of problems you are scoring low
                    on. The program then has a practice page with problems for all 4 sections: Reading, Writing, 
                    Math with no calculator, and Math with calculator. Each skill for a specific section is ranked from 1-4 indicating your mastery
                    of a specific skill. The Khan Academy SAT program has proven to be one of the best SAT preparation resources for high schoolers,
                    no matter your target score.</li>

                    some of the SAT and ACT strategies that may be difficult to grasp as they may not be covered heavily in high school classrooms, such as
                    the importance of skimming passages. Their 
                    online SAT and ACT courses do cost, but they provide an exhaustive bank of practice problems that automatically pinpoint your weaknesses
                    in order to make you as well-rounded as possible before the test.
