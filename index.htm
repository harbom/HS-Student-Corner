    <p>Math can be difficult for many high schoolers because of its complexity and the practice that is needed to develop mastery
        of the subject. Here are few resources to help with most of the math courses taught throughout the US.</h2>
    
    <h2>Common high school mathematics courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Geometry, Algebra 2, Pre-Calculus, AP Statistics*, AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC*</h3>
    <p>
            These math courses aim to build on the fundamental algabraic concepts needed in college mathematics. There are plenty
            of sites that walk through problems step by step in order to educate students and help them understand the otherwise 
            complex math topics for high school students.

            <li><a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/math"target = "_blank">Khan Academy</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Khan Academy offers a wide vareity of math tutoring covering virtually all mathematics courses possible,
                    from as early as 1st grade math to complex courses like Multivariable Calculus. Content is usually taught through
                    videos that walk one through a problem or problem type. A short quiz is then given to confirm understanding
                    of the subject. This site is especially fun as it gives out badges and acheivements for certain goals, providing
                    incentive to study mathematics!

                <ul>
                    <li>Purplemath is a bank of informal lessons teaching students the more fundamental lessons of mathematics, like
                    seen in Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, and Algebra 2. It starts to teach trignometry, which is covered in Pre-Calculus,
                    but it doesn't extend its lessons as far as Khan Acaemy does. Nevertheless, it is a great resource for practice
                    problems and thoroughly understanding the various types of problems seen in high school.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>This site is one of the most informal math sites because it focuses on fun scenarios, math puzzles, and interactives
                        to help one understand a problem. It stretches from basic algebra and geometry to calculus, statistics,
                        and even physics. This site is great if you're looking for a simple explanation for any type of math problem.

                <ul>
                    <li>Compared to other sites teaching mathematics, the Art of Problem Solving is the most rigorous. Conventional resources
                        teach by showing an example first, and then giving the students problems to work through. AOPS, on the other hand,
                        forces you to work through an unfamiliar problem first, before being taught the main lesson. Although this sounds
                        harsh, it is an excellent style of teaching as students retain the information for a longer time. It offers a bank
                        of practice problems called Alcumus, which streches from Pre-Algebra to Pre-Calculus, which is a great way
                        to hone your math skills in any topic. AOPS also offers books and online courses that one can buy which cover topics 
                        from Pre-Algebra to AP Calculus BC, Number Theory, and even Probability/Statistics. If you are able to master the problems offered 
                        by AOPS, you are sure to ace any math problem that is thrown at you. AOPS is also the best way to prepare for 
                        mathematics competitions such as AMC 8, AMC 10, AMC 12, AIME, or USAMO.

    <p>High school science courses are varied and aim to teach students the fundamentals of basic science subjects, focusing the most on
        biology, chemistry, and physics. Sometimes, as seen in courses like
        biology, concepts become memorization heavy. Use any combination of the following resources to help you excel in the courses listed and beyond.
    </p>
    <h2>Common high school science courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Biology, Chemistry, Physics, AP Biology*, AP Chemistry*, AP Physics 1/2*, AP Physics C Electricity/Magnetism*, AP Environmental Science*</h3>
    <p> The following resources will mainly cover biology, chemistry, and physics, but can be used for other science courses as many concepts from
        these courses overlap, as seen in biology and chemistry. </p>

                        a topic in science, such as Aqueous Equilibrium in Chemistry.
                        These videos are produced with a generous dose of humor that helps to 'diffuse' science concepts.

                        question banks and free apps that can supplement the inforation from a traditional high school physics course.

                        preparation. Through intense and easy-to-follow lessons, practice tests, and online resources, the Barron's guides are ample
                        preparation for any high school science course.
