    <p>Math can be difficult for many high schoolers because of its complexity and the practice that is needed to develop mastery
        of the subject. Here are few resources to help with most of the math courses taught throughout the US.</h2>
    
    <h2>Common high school mathematics courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Pre-Algebra, Algebra 1, Pre-AP/On Level Geometry, Pre-AP/On Level Algebra 2, On-Ramps/Pre-AP/On Level Pre-Calculus, AP/On Level Statistics*, AP Calculus AB*, AP Calculus BC*</h3>
    <p>
            These math courses aim to build on the fundamental algabraic concepts needed in college mathematics. There are plenty
            of sites that walk through problems step by step in order to educate students and help them understand the otherwise 
            complex math topics for high school students.

    <p>Science courses are varied and aim to teach students the fundamentals of basic science subjects, focusing mostly on
        biology, chemistry, and physics.
        biology, concepts become memorization heavy. Use any combination of the following resources to help you excel in the courses listed and beyond.
    </p>
    <h2>Common high school science courses in order:</h2>
    <h3>Pre-AP/On Level Biology, Pre-AP/On Level Chemistry, Pre-AP/On Level Physics, AP Biology*, AP Chemistry*, AP Physics 1/2*, AP Physics C Electricity/Magnetism*, AP Environmental Science*,
        Earth and Space Science*
    </h3>
    <p> The following resources will mainly cover biology, chemistry, and physics, but can be used for other science courses as many concepts from
        these courses overlap, as seen in biology and chemistry. </p>
